 <Description>This is a really nice pair of Tommy Hilfiger
denim jeans for little boy - 18-24 months. These were my son's
jeans and he only wore them 2 times so they are like new!!!
Jeans have two pockets in front and 2 pockets on rear. Hilfiger
emblem is on front right pocket and on rear right pocket. Jeans
have belt loops and snap up crotch for easy diaper changes.
Really nice jeans - just like new!!! I think I paid around 35.00
for these at Dillard's. Buyer to pay 3.95 shipping. Insurance is
available for 3.95. Seller is not responsible for packages once
left at post office if uninsured. All sales are final. We prefer
Paypal payments but we also accept m/o and cks. with 7-10 day
hold on cks. Thanks for bidding and good luck!!! Merry
Christmas!!! We ship on Wed. and Fri.</Description>
